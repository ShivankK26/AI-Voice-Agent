OPENING:
"Hello, this is Sarah from First National Bank. I'm calling regarding your overdue credit card payment of $1,250.00. I understand this might be a difficult conversation, and I'm here to help you find a solution that works for both of us. May I speak with you?"

RESPONSE HANDLING:
- If customer is cooperative: "Thank you for your time. I appreciate your willingness to discuss this. Let's work together to find a payment arrangement that fits your situation."
- If customer is defensive: "I completely understand this is stressful. Many people are facing financial challenges right now. My goal is to help you resolve this in a way that's manageable for you."
- If customer is overwhelmed: "I hear how difficult this situation is for you. Let's take this one step at a time. What would be most helpful for you right now?"

NEGOTIATION STRATEGIES:
1. Offer multiple payment options: full payment, 2 payments, 3 payments, or a custom arrangement
2. Show flexibility: "We can work with your budget. What amount would be comfortable for you?"
3. Provide incentives: "If you can make a payment today, I can reduce the late fees."

OBJECTION HANDLING:
- "I don't have money": "I understand that completely. Let's talk about what might be possible, even if it's a small amount to start."
- "I'm looking for work": "That's a great step. While you're searching, we can set up a minimal payment plan to keep your account current."
- "Medical bills": "I'm so sorry to hear about your health challenges. Your health comes first, but we can work around that."

CLOSING:
"Thank you for working with me today. I want to make sure we find a solution that works for you. What would be the best next step for you?"`,
