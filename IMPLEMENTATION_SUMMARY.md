# LiveKit Voice Agent Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a debt collection voice agent using LiveKit and Next.js. The application provides a complete foundation for AI-powered voice interactions with robust conversation handling and a modern user interface.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **LiveKit Integration** ✅
- **Token Generation API**: Secure authentication endpoint at `/api/token`
- **Room Management**: Real-time voice communication setup
- **Participant Handling**: Track customer connections and disconnections
- **Audio/Video Support**: Full WebRTC capabilities for voice calls

### 2. **AI Agent Logic** ✅
- **Conversation Flow**: 6-stage debt collection conversation:
  - Greeting & Identification
  - Payment Reminder
  - Objection Handling
  - Payment Options
  - Closing
- **Smart Responses**: Context-aware responses based on customer input
- **Objection Handling**: Recognizes and responds to common customer objections
- **Payment Plans**: Offers flexible payment arrangements

### 3. **User Interface** ✅
- **Modern Design**: Clean, professional interface with Tailwind CSS
- **Real-time Status**: Live agent status and conversation state
- **Call Logging**: Comprehensive conversation tracking
- **Interactive Controls**: Easy-to-use buttons for testing scenarios

### 4. **Debt Collection Features** ✅
- **Professional Script**: Bank representative persona (Sarah from First National Bank)
- **Payment Scenarios**: $1,500 overdue credit card balance
- **Flexible Options**: 3 payment plans (full payment, 2 installments, 3 installments)
- **Objection Responses**: Handles financial hardship, timing issues, etc.

## Key Features

### **Robust Voice Agent** ✅
- Handles edge cases and unexpected responses
- Graceful error handling and fallbacks
- Professional conversation flow

### **Human-like Conversation** ✅
- Natural, polite tone throughout
- Context-aware responses
- Professional debt collection script

### **Easy to Use** ✅
- Simple setup with clear instructions
- Intuitive interface for testing
- Real-time feedback and status updates

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd riverline-assignment
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Configure LiveKit**:
   - Sign up at [cloud.livekit.io](https://cloud.livekit.io/)
   - Get API key, secret, and WebSocket URL
   - Update `.env.local` with your credentials

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. **Test the Voice Agent**:
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "Launch Voice Agent"
   - Use the interface to simulate conversations

## Demo Scenario

The voice agent simulates a credit card debt collection call:

1. **Greeting**: "Hello, this is Sarah from First National Bank..."
2. **Identification**: Confirms account holder and mentions $1,500 overdue balance
3. **Payment Discussion**: Offers flexible payment options
4. **Objection Handling**: Responds to customer concerns professionally
5. **Closing**: Confirms payment plan and provides next steps

## Next Steps for Twilio Integration

The foundation is ready for Twilio phone integration:

1. **Install Twilio SDK**: `yarn add twilio`
2. **Create Phone Endpoint**: Add `/api/call` for outbound calls
3. **Configure Twilio**: Set up phone numbers and webhooks
4. **Connect to LiveKit**: Bridge Twilio calls to LiveKit rooms
5. **Add Voice Synthesis**: Integrate TTS for AI responses

## Testing the Application

### Manual Testing
1. Start the development server
2. Open the voice agent interface
3. Click "Start Collection Script"
4. Simulate customer responses in the input field
5. Observe the AI agent's responses and conversation flow

### Expected Behavior
- Agent starts with professional greeting
- Responds appropriately to customer input
- Handles objections gracefully
- Offers payment options
- Maintains professional tone throughout
