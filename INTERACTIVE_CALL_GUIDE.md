# ðŸŽ¤ Interactive Call System Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We Fixed**

The "application error" was caused by LiveKit SIP connection issues. We've implemented a **robust alternative** that works reliably:

- âœ… **No more SIP connection errors**
- âœ… **Real speech recognition**
- âœ… **Interactive AI conversations**
- âœ… **Reliable call flow**

## ðŸ”„ **How It Works Now**

### **Call Flow:**
1. **AI Agent speaks**: "Hello, this is Sarah from First National Bank..."
2. **Listens for your response**: Uses Twilio's speech recognition
3. **Claude AI processes**: Your speech and generates response
4. **AI responds**: Speaks back naturally
5. **Continues conversation**: Until you hang up or no response

### **Technology Stack:**
- **Twilio Speech Recognition** - Understands what you say
- **Claude AI** - Generates intelligent responses
- **TwiML Gather** - Handles conversation flow
- **No LiveKit SIP** - Eliminates connection issues
